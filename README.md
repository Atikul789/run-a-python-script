# run-a-python-script

First, download python 3: https://www.python.org/downloads/  
In setup, check "Add Python to PATH".  
  
Once Python is installed, open a terminal in directory where script is and run `pip install -r requirements.txt`.  
Then, you can launch script by running `python scriptname.py` :)
